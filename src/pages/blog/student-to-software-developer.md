## 🎯 1. Self-Assessment: Know Your Interests and Strengths

Before diving into technical skills, reflect on your interests. Do you enjoy building web interfaces, solving algorithmic puzzles, or exploring data? Knowing this helps choose between front-end, back-end, full stack, mobile development, DevOps, or data science roles.

### Ask yourself:
- Do I prefer visual design or logic-based problem solving?
- Am I more drawn to development, analysis, or infrastructure?
- Do I enjoy working solo or in team settings?

This clarity will guide your learning path and project choices.
