## **How We Prepare Semester-Wise Important Questions**  

### **Step 1: Collect Past Papers & Syllabus**  
- We gather **5-10 years of question papers** (university/library sources).  
- Map them to the **latest syllabus** to filter outdated topics.  

### **Step 2: Identify Repeated Topics**  
Using **topic frequency analysis**, we detect:  
🔹 **Most repeated questions** (e.g., "Explain OSI model" in Computer Networks)  
🔹 **Trending topics** (e.g., AI in 2024 syllabus)  
🔹 **Professor-specific patterns** (for college-specific exams)  

*Example:*  
| **Topic** | **Frequency (Last 5 Years)** |  
|----------|----------------------------|  
| SQL Joins | 4 times |  
| Normalization | 3 times |  

### **Step 3: Categorize by Marks Weightage**  
We classify questions into:  
- **Short answers (2-5 marks)**  
- **Long answers (10 marks)**  
- **Numericals/Diagrams**  

### **Step 4: Add Model Answers**  
Each question includes:  
✔ **Concise bullet-point answers** (for quick revision)  
✔ **Diagrams/flowcharts** (where applicable)  
✔ **Expected variations** (e.g., "Compare TCP vs UDP")  

### **Step 5: Verify with Educators**  
Our **subject experts** cross-check:  
- **Accuracy** (no incorrect answers)  
- **Completeness** (covers all units)
